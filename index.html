    <!-- ABOUT -->

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Business Administration &amp; Economics student (GPA 3.8) who enjoys turning analysis into action.
        This past summer I interned with a sports operations company and redesigned their reservation check-in process —
        a small change that cut errors by 78% and showed me how operational tweaks can create big financial impact.
        I also serve as a Risk Analyst on a $700K student-managed portfolio, where I balance quantitative analysis with practical decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the classroom, I compete in both NCAA Division III and semi-professional soccer and founded my college Pickleball Club.
        Sports have been a constant in my life, and they’ve taught me as much about commitment and teamwork as any classroom.
        Next semester, I’ll be studying abroad in Barcelona to broaden both my academic and cultural perspective.
        I start my mornings with Bloomberg and WSJ market briefings, and in my free time I enjoy following AI creators to see how new tools are shaping business workflows.

        <strong>Market Note (Aug 2025):</strong>
        I’ve been following how companies are experimenting with AI tools in marketing. Even though the field is early,
        it’s interesting to see how automation could change entry-level roles like internships — more focus on strategy, less on repetitive tasks.
